# Simple Web Server

A mini HTTP web server that uses a thread pool to respond asynchronously.

Supports 2 commandline arguments - threads(no of threads) and port(port number). Default threads is 4 and default port is 7878.

For example to run the server with 10 worker threads listening at port 8787, run the following command -  
./mini-web-server 10 8787
